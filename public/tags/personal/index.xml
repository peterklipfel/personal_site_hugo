      <description>Tada We got married at the Four Seasons in Koh Samui, Thailand. Our closest friends and family were in attendance.

      <description>Intro This will just be a brief blog post to say hello again. Hello!
Where did I go? To those of you who were starting to be regular readers, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for abandoning this. I had an opportunity to work with my brother on some very fun projects. This took up most of my energy, and I neglected my interests in biology for a while.
What to expect Probably more of the same.</description>
