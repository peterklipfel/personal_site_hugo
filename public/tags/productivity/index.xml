      <description>How Remote work has affected me I&amp;rsquo;m writing this while lying on the living room floor with a pillow under me. This is a practice I developed while working through some chronic pain. I was unable to sit for long periods, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a standing desk (and standing doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as well as laying down for me). I find that it provides me with a nice, low intensity shoulder workout, stretches some of the muscles that form when I&amp;rsquo;m hunched over a computer while sitting, and let&amp;rsquo;s me flop over when I want to think.</description>

      <description>Tl;dr I use obsidian for desktop, IA Writer for mobile, and keep everything in sync with Dropbox.
Taking notes is hard During college, while I was freelancing, I developed a habit of taking notes. This has served me well since then, and I have tried to manage my notes in more ways than I can remember.
The ones that I can remember trying are: Google Keep, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter notebooks, Aha!</description>
