      <description>What are gene libraries At a high level, gene libraries are collections of DNA fragments from a genome. The library may contain the whole genome, or it may contain only a section of the genome.
There are 2 primary kinds of gene libraries
 Geonmic libraries cDNA libraries  Genomic libraries This is the complete collection. If you want all the DNA from an organism, you are going to be creating a genomic library.</description>

      <description>What are cosmids? Special plasmids Cosmids are just a specific kind of plasmid, which are indpendent units of DNA that can move between bacteria. That is, they are similar to viruses in that they&amp;rsquo;re in the gray area of what we might consider &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo;, but they are different from viruses in that they do not code for their own protective membrane like a virus or a cell would.
One misconception that I had during my learning about cosmids was how they can have longer sequences than regular plasmids.</description>

      <description>Intro This will just be a brief blog post to say hello again. Hello!
Where did I go? To those of you who were starting to be regular readers, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for abandoning this. I had an opportunity to work with my brother on some very fun projects. This took up most of my energy, and I neglected my interests in biology for a while.
What to expect Probably more of the same.</description>

      <description>Overview Cells are just pockets of proteins in a bubble of fat. You may know fat by the way that it sticks to your pans after you&amp;rsquo;re done cooking. It&amp;rsquo;s the layer of grease that coats your cookware. Typically, you can&amp;rsquo;t just rinse the grease away, you need an agent that breaks up the grease.
Broadly speaking, cells are made up of similar stuff to the grease that&amp;rsquo;s on your plates and pans.</description>

      <description>Overview Neurons are usually &amp;ldquo;grown&amp;rdquo; in two steps. First, they reproduce to become more cells. This is the intuitive meaning of cells growing (at least to me), and will be the subject of this post. Then, they are differentiated into the necessary neuronal cells that make up the culture. These are broadly divided into neural cells and glial cells.
Neural cells These are the cells that are typically depicted as brain cells in popular culture.</description>

      <description>Overview Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose you want to store cell lines for future use. The most obvious option would be to put them in an incubator and let them continue growing. But this would require some maintenance, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty inconvenient if you want to do other things like move the cells. Another option might be to freeze them. But this has a pretty high liklihood of killing cells. When water freezes, the ice crystals in the cell can wreak havoc on the cell.</description>

      <description>Overview I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about systems biology recently, and MAP Kinase seems to come up a lot. Systems biology is all about drawing maps between various biological processes like which genes create what proteins and how those proteins interact with each other. MAP kinase is often shown as an intermediary between various processes. MAP stands for Mitogen Activated Protein. This seems pretty self-explanatory if we understand what a &amp;ldquo;Mitogen&amp;rdquo; is. So let&amp;rsquo;s go over that.</description>

      <description>Overview Say you want to study a new drug, and you want to see if there are any interesting effects on human tissue. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve infected the tissue with a virus, and you want to see if the drug does what you think it does. It&amp;rsquo;s still early in the study, so you don&amp;rsquo;t want to give it to real humans yet.
This is a very common practice, but it assumes that you can get tissue easily.</description>

      <description>Overview I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering about the differences between proteins and enzymes, and thought it would be good to start from first principles. In this post, I wanted to talk broadly about how proteins are made from DNA.
Amino acids DNA is made of strings like GCCCGTAATAGTACATTACGA; This is translated in triplets into amino acids, and groups of amino acids produce proteins. So, if we grouped this into triplets, it would look like: (GCC)(CGT)(AAT)(AGT)(ACA)(TTA)(CGA).</description>

      <description>Overview The first word in &amp;ldquo;lac operon&amp;rdquo; refers to lactose, and the second word refers to the structure of the genes. Usually, when people discuss the lac operon, they do so in the context of e. coli. Though e. coli is not the only bacteria that can have the lac operon, it&amp;rsquo;s usually what people are referring to. I will continue that tradition.
Lactose is a type of sugar often found in milk.</description>

      <guid>/blog/dna_methylation_in_prokaryotes/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I was researching possible failure modes of plasmid transfection in e. coli, and I came across a post that mentioned DNA methylation as a possible problem. I had not dug into this before, and discovered that it is an entire field of study within biology. Before I realized how broad the topic was, I anticipated writing this blog post on DNA methylation; I then reduced its scope to only prokaryotes, though I will talk a little bit about how DNA methylation affects eukaryotic organisms as well in order to provide more context for what it does and how it works.</description>

      <description>Which Coronavirus? There are many types of coronaviruses. Similarly to cancer, if we say &amp;ldquo;she is sick with coronavirus&amp;rdquo;, there are several questions that are left unanswered. If we were to say &amp;ldquo;she is sick with cancer&amp;rdquo;, we might follow up with &amp;ldquo;what kind of cancer?&amp;rdquo;. There are 7 known coronaviruses that infect humans
 Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) SARS-CoV Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63, New Haven coronavirus) Human coronavirus HKU1 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and HCoV-EMC.</description>

      <description>Overview Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking it would be really cool to have a synthetic greenhouse; full of plants that could be found nowhere in nature. Flowers that glow in the dark, leaves that fluoresce under UV light, cucumbers that smell like vanilla, potatoes that taste like oranges. I&amp;rsquo;m getting a little ahead of myself, but it would be cool.
This post will go over some techniques that are used to introduce new genes into plants.</description>

      <description>Overview Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about transfection of e. coli using heat shock in my post on plasmids. Transfection into single celled organisms can be relatively simple. Using heat and electricity, we can take an artificial plasmid and add it to e. coli or yeast. This synthetic addition to the DNA in a cell codes for a protein that we want, and the cell will now produce that protein like a small factory.</description>

      <description>Overview One project that I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the back of my mind is inventing new dyes based on colors in insects. Dyes created by biological mechanisms can be much more environmentally friendly than those created with chemicals. Unfortuantely, I have not found anywhere to buy the DNA that I want - in many cases, the genomes haven&amp;rsquo;t even been sequenced yet. Both of these problems will require me to isolate the DNA myself.</description>

      <description>Overview One of the driving factors behind the recent explosion in progress in synthetic biology has to do with the cost and speed of genome sequencing and synthesis. Here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on genome sequencing. There are lots of companies that will do this for you, and lots of lab devices that you can buy so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the sequencing yourself, but I thought it would be worthwhile for me to understand what it takes to sequence DNA.</description>

      <description>Why do I care about this? In this post, I wanted to go over what bioinformatics does for synthetic biologists. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer by training, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even taken some of a bioinformatics course. But I still didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what the purpose of bioinformatics was. More importantly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how what I do for a living now - AI - could help with it.
Bioinformatics is an entire field, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to do it justice in a single blog post.</description>

      <description>What is a BAC? Previously, I wrote about plasmids as small, circular DNA sequences. The double edged sword of normal plasmids is that they are small. This can make them easier to reason about, but it can make them inconvenient for some uses. For example, if you wanted to study the herpes virus, it might be useful to have bacteria that carry the genome of the virus. BACs allow biologists to study organisms more holistically, but without having to actually raise the organism.</description>

      <description>What is a plasmid? Whenever I start looking into genes and genomes, I eventually end up at a circular diagram with highlighted sections with gene name labels. I understood that these represented genetic information, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand why I should care about them.
Being new at this whole biology thing forces me to remind myself of the fundamentals pretty often. In this case, I have to go back to the fundamentals of what DNA actually is.</description>

      <guid>/blog/polymerase_chain_reaction_pcr/</guid>
      <description>Why do synthetic biologists use PCR? One of the foundations of synthetic biology is being able to put new genes into organisms that did not previously have them. Unfortunately, genes don&amp;rsquo;t naturally come in buckets of purified DNA segments; we have to make those ourselves. And this is where PCR comes in. If you happened to find a really cool jelly fish that glowed under UV light, you sequenced that jellyfish&amp;rsquo;s genome, and identified the gene that makes it glow, you might be able to take that gene from the jellyfish and add it to other organisms in order to make them glow as well.</description>

      <description>Back when I was first starting on my adventures in software, there was so much to learn. Even with the copious resources available, I still found it difficult to wrap my head around concepts that people were writing about. I felt like if someone could frame the problem for me correctly - and sometimes someone would - then I would have been able to learn things much faster. This will be a blog about my adventures into biology.</description>
