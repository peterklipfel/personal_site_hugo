# What is this?

This is a list of resources that I have found to be useful in my own exploration and learning. I will continue to update it based on what I use.

# Resources

* protocols.io - lots of open protocols
* [openwetware](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Protocols) - open protocols
* Benchling - Bunches of useful tools for labs
* [bitesizebio](https://bitesizebio.com/) - Lots of useful articles
