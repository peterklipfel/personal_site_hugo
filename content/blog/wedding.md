We got married at the Four Seasons in Koh Samui, Thailand. Our closest friends and family were in attendance.

I'm not going to add too many pictures because I try to be cautious about what gets put on the internet. I'd happy to share more pictures if you're interested in seeing them.


Here was our room:

And here's us:

Thank you again to everyone who went. It was unforgettable. If we meet in person, I'd be happy to tell you the story of why I have a tattoo from this trip.
