What could be more fulfilling than spending a life discovering new limits to what is possible? 

Once upon a time, there was a curious person. He was interested in finding out how if he could turn a falling brick into heat. So he set up an experiment by which a rather large brick was tied with rope to 4 paddles in a bucket of water. Imagine yourself for a moment being invited by friends to a party, and responding to them with: "no thanks, I'm going to stay in tonight and spin some water around in a bucket to see if anything interesting happens". Such is the call of curiosity. Now, I'm not sure if he turned down a party to do the experiment, but the person who first performed this experiment was named James Joule, and he has been immortalized for it. Generations from now, people will know the name "Joule" because he spun some water in a bucket. Now, I'm not saying this because I think that there's glory in it for you if you do science, but rather to prove the point that curiosity is powerful. So powerful, in fact, that it causes names to echo through history for centuries.

My interest in synthetic biology has been driven by a couple of my new heroes. One of them is Josiah Zayner. He strikes me as a full-blooded, def-con hacker ethic kind of dude. A true scientist. One experiment he did was to inject himself in front of an audience with CRISPR. I am a huge fan of this stunt. I think it's important to remind us all that science doesn't need billions of dollars of funding to bring a new drug to market. It's about splashing water around in a bucket to see if anything interesting happens. In Josiah's case, the question is "what will happen if I put CRISPR in me?". The answer seems to be: basically nothing. But he got a lot of people out of their seats because he asked "what if?". And we need more of that.

The grant system is the best we have, but it does have the tendency to make science rather political. It pushes people toward trying to become celebrities instead of being curious. If you're famous in your field, people tend to give you money. There is a lot of "science" that is done in order to obtain a 

I've recently become interested in synthetic biology, and one of the big subjects in synthetic biology is ethics. We are now starting to talk about editing the substrate of our existence, and if we screw it up, a lot of the consequences lead directly to death - this is why new drugs are so hard to get approved. The interesting part, though, is not death, but the fantastic futures that we might enable with the inventions that these tools give us.
