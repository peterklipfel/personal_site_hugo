# Book reviews
I read and listen to a lot of books. Historically, I've just created a sentence or two after finishing the book or lecture series, but after reading the Mahabharata, I wanted a better format for discussing the books that I had been reading. Coincidentally, this was right around the time that I discovered Derek Sivers' book reviews; my book reviews are partially inspired by his posts, but follow a different format.

The point of the reviews is to help myself remember the books that I've read, and to have a reference to them that is more personal than whatever sparknotes thinks I should remember.
